Ajax Drop Down Demo for JeremyMorgan.com

{% img center https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/jeremymorgan/hosted/php-mysql-ajax-tutorial.jpg Your first PHP Ajax App %}

This is the source code for a tutorial I wrote for my blog titled [How to Create an Ajax Drop Down Menu With PHP and MySQL](http://www.jeremymorgan.com/tutorials/php-tutorials/how-to-create-an-ajax-drop-down-menu-with-php-and-mysql/).

This is the downloadable source for this article. It is two PHP files and assumes some very basic credentials for the MySQL server. I have also included the SQL dump for the tables. 

###Caution: Do not use this code in a production environment or on a public website

This code was built for demonstration and tutorial purposes only. I sacrificed security and good practices in favor of simplicity. This is merely meant to explain how Ajax works. 

That being said if you would like to use this is your own tutorial, feel free to or even fork it and create your own styles for it.
